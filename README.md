# Kanes-Ultimate-TTT

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a game of ultimate strategy, deception and betrayal.  I built this program for the first project in a Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly. This web program allows you to play Tic Tac Toe on a single screen.

### Technologies used:
*  Git
*  AJAX
*  jQuery
*  Bootstrap
*  Javascript
*  HTML
*  CSS
*  GitHub
*  GitHub Enterprise
*  Heroku

**Nothing needs to be installed to run and use this program besides a web browser**

 **[You can play my game here](https://kanetheinsane.github.io/Kanes-Ultimate-TTT/)**

## My organizational strategy and process

I built my game in a 4 day period, I approached the problem by breaking it up into steps.
First I made my [wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/UPHLJu) and [user stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wudfHGWM7rPGWo77dNYKamerVRqQxQKFvquoIPEU17Q/edit)
in order to understand what I wanted the final product. The next step for me was building the game logic. Further breaking things into steps I used an array to represent the game board in JavaScript. building up the logic functionally. After tackling that I moved into my authorization methods built using Ajax and Jquery to communicate to an API that was already built. Finally I built the stylized the page using css and sass.

My over all strategy to keep things moving was to focus on what I knew I could complete first and continue working on that one piece until I was finished without jumping around. By doing this I could make sure I was building off of working componentes. The pieces that worked well could further guide my programming decisions

### Some problems left to solve

* I want to build a simple AI to play against. I started building the logic in the game-events-ai.js file
but it is still very buggy and is not deployed in the current version
* I want to add confetti on game win
* I want to add background music that I composed to complete the 90s site look and feel
